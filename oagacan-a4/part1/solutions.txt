a. ∀ a b ∈ ℤ . a + b = b + a (addition is commutative)
   ∀ a b ∈ ℤ . a x b = b x a (multiplication is commutative)

b. ∀ a b ∈ ℤ . ∃ c ∈ ℤ . a + b = c (addition is closure over ℤ)
   ∀ a b ∈ ℤ . ∃ c ∈ ℤ . a x b = c (multiplication is closure over ℤ)

c. ∀ a b c ∈ ℤ . a x (b + c) = (a x b) + (b x c)
                   (multiplication distributes over addition)

d. ∀ a b c ∈ ℤ . a x (b x c) = (a x b) x c
                   (multiplication is associative)
   ∀ a b c ∈ ℤ . a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c
                   (addition is associative)

e. ∀ a ∈ ℤ . ∃ b ∈ ℤ . a + b = a (addition has an identity)
   ∀ a ∈ ℤ . ∃ b ∈ ℤ . a * b = a (multiplication has an identity)

   We can also express a stronger variant, saying that identity is actually a
   fixed integer.

   ∀ a ∈ ℤ . a + 0 = a (addition has an identity, it's 0)
   ∀ a ∈ ℤ . a * 1 = a (multiplication has an identity, it's 1)

The entailment doesn't hold. We give two arguments,

1. Intuitively, "for an x, either P(x) or Q(x) holds" is not the same thing as
   "P(x) holds for all x or Q(x) holds for all x". Of course this is not a
   proof, because mapping logic formulae to a spoken language usually doesn't
   work well. Hence we have (2)

2. Suppose we have two x: x1 and x2, and

    P(x1) holds        but P(x2) doesn't hold.
    Q(x1) doesn't hold but Q(x2) holds.

    And further suppose that X = {x1, x2}.

    In this universe(model), ∀x(P(x) ∨ Q(x)) holds, because for x1 P(x) holds
    and for x2 Q(x) holds.

    But ∀x P(x) doesn't hold and ∀x Q(x) doesn't hold. Because P(x2) doesn't
    hold and Q(x1) doesn't hold.

    Since those don't hold, their OR doesn't hold either:
    (∀x P(x)) ∨ (∀x Q(x))
