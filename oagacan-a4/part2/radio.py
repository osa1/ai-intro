# NOTE [Our solution]
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# This is really the most naive solution + a very simple optimization that gives
# us huge boost. In fact, this is currently so fast that it solves the problem
# without any constraints in 0.013s.
#
# Here's how it works, without the main optimization: It just recursively
# searches, starting from first unassigned city. After every assignment we copy
# the whole state(which is just a map from cities to assignments). We do some
# simple optimizations for fast assignment lookup(like memoizing hash() of
# cities).
#
# Copying is super fast so it's not worth optimizing(run profile.py to
# generate profiling data).
#
# We do constraint propagation: When assigning a frequency during the search, we
# check assigned neighbors. If a neighbor uses frequence A for example, we don't
# try A at all.
#
# This version solves the problems with some constraints in a couple of seconds
# but unconstrained case takes forever. However, we do one very simple
# optimization that gives us _huge_ boost. We start assigning frequencies with
# the state that constraints others the most. E.g. we start with state with most
# number of neighbors.
#
# This really solves the whole thing. Previously unconstrained case was taking
# forever. After this optimization we solve unconstrained case in 0.023s.
# (note that Python startup takes 0.010s)
#
# NOTE [Backtracks]
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# With the optimizations described above, we don't do any backtracking. For
# testing, we can comment out `graph.sort(...)` line which disables the
# optimization and we do thousands of backtracks.
#
# NOTE [Future improvements]
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# There's one more improvement we could do. When we have more than one state
# with same number of neighbors, we could first assign the one with least number
# of possible alternative frequencies.
#
# But current solution already solves the worst case in 0.13s(excluding Python
# startup). So there's really no need for any further optimizations.
#
# NOTE [Recursive implementation is fine]
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Why? Because we have 50 states. A depth-first search would go as deep as 50
# call frames, which is perfectly fine. No risk of stack overflow.
#
# Note that Python's default stack size is 1000 on most systems. So our
# implementation handles problems up to 1000 states without any stack overflows.
# Since problem statement doesn't specify anything about number of states, we
# don't bother maintaining a stack.
#
# NOTE [Profiling]
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Here I list times needed to solve constraints-4.
