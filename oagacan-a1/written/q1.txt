# Written question 1

For 2x2 board, it's sufficient to show only for single starting state, because
other states are all rotations of this initial state.

X starts:

1)   x _
     _ _

2)   x o           x _            x _
     _ _           o _            _ o

3)   x o    x o    x x    x _     x x    x _
     x _    _ x    o _    o x     _ o    x o

X loses in all cases.

If O starts, same things happen, except we replace X's with O's and vice-versa.
Which means that first player always loses.
