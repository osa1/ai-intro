# Written question 2

It's not admissible. We prove it by showing a counterexample(e.g. an
overestimated case).

Suppose we have this state:

    1 2 3
    4 5 _
    7 8 6

We can solve this puzzle in one move, by moving 6 up. But the heuristic cost
assigned to this state is 2: One number(6) smaller than 7 comes after 7,
similarly for 8.

So this heuristic overestimates, and so is not admissible.
