    ### NOTE [Filling missing information]
    #
    # We have some roads with missing distance or max speeds, here how we fill
    # those missing info:
    #
    # First, we assume that missing info is actually max speed and not
    # distance, becuase when we look at the malformed lines, e.g.
    #
    #   Antigonish,_Nova_Scotia Tracadie,_Nova_Scotia 30  NS_104
    #
    # We see that there's extra space between the number and road name. This
    # suggests that the speed was not printed, but the space after it was
    # printed. The extra space would be between the destination and the number
    # if it was the other way around. e.g. something like:
    #
    #   Antigonish,_Nova_Scotia Tracadie,_Nova_Scotia  30 NS_104
    #
    # Then, we take arithmetic mean of all the speeds we read from the file,
    # and use that as speeds of missing lines.
    #
    # The advantage of this method is that it doesn't have any effect on the
    # algorithms, it doesn't make anything more complex. Hopefully it's not too
    # inaccurate either.
