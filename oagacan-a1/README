# NOTES ABOUT SOLUTIONS

I tried to document my code extensively, hopefully they explain every
non-standard thing I do. Here are some other details.

## Programming problem 1

Program: q1/main.py

I also have a Prolog implementation that I hacked just to test my
implementation. (q1/main.pl)


## Programming problem 2

Program: q2/route.py

I don't think it's possible to implement an admissible heuristic in this
question, because of missing GPS locations of some cities and missing distances
of some roads. The whole Quebec region is missing. In total we have 1052
missing GPS locations(some of them are for connections rather than cities).
Some of the cities with missing GPS info are connected to only one other
city(which makes predicting a location hard). Roads with unknown distances and
max speeds etc. makes things even worse.

Before running the algorithm I fill all the missing information. I do it like this:

- For cities with missing GPS information, I use middle point of it's
  neighbors. If it has only one neighbor, then I make it's location same as
  it's neighbor.

- For roads with missing max speed, I use average max speed of all roads.

- For roads with missing distances, I use straight line distance of two points.

Then I run A*, bfs, dfs etc. (I also implemented uniform cost aka. Dijkstra's,
but there's no way to use it from the command line. See route_test.py)

BFS and DFS doesn't care about cost functions(distance, time etc.) since they
just searched in the graph until they reach the goal node.

For A* I have different cost functions and heuristics depending on the goal.
(see code)


## Programming problem 3

Program: q3/solver16.py

Unfortunately my program can solve only very simple cases(others take forever).
This puzzle is very easy to solve(I can solve it in a minute most of the time),
but finding an optimal solution using heuristics turned out to be very hard.

Some other things I implemented:

- game.py: I implemented the game just to experiment with some ideas and
  manually check if my program returned a valid/correct solution. Requires
  pygame.

- My program works on arbitrary board sizes. Although it's having problems with
  sizes >= 4. :)

# Original README

This is a simple dataset of North American (though mostly U.S.) major roads.

city-gps.txt contains one line per city, with three fields per line,
delimited by spaces. The first field is the city, followed by the latitude,
followed by the longitude.

road-segments.txt has one line per road segment connecting two cities.
The space delimited fields are:

- first city
- second city
- length (in miles)
- speed limit (in miles per hour)
- name of highway


Note that there are mistakes and bugs in these files and your code should
still operate correctly; e.g. not all cities that appear in road-segments.txt
have a corresponding line in city-gps.txt. You should assume that all roads
in road-segments.txt are bidirectional, i.e. none are one-way roads, so
that it's possible to travel from the first city to the second city at the
same distance at speed as from the second city to the first city.
