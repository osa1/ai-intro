# Question 4

P(recvNo | sentYes) = 40%
P(recvYes | sentNo) = 20%

P(rainNext |   rainToday) = 65%
P(rainNext | - rainToday) = 25%

## (a)

sent1 -----> sent2 -----> sent3 -----> sent4
  |            |            |            |
  V            V            V            V
recvd1       recvd2       recvd3       recvd4

"sent": A yes message is sent.
"recvd": A yes message is received.

sent1 influences sent2, because if it rained yesterday we know there's 65%
probability that it's going to rain today. So if we sent "yes" yesterday the
probability that we're going to send "yes" today is 65%.

recvd1 influences recvd2, because for example if we know we got a "yes"
yesterday, we can say something about the probability that we'll read a "yes"
today, because we know that it rained yesterday with 60% probability, and if it
rained yesterday it'll rain today with 65% probability. When combined, this
makes the probability that today it'll rain and the sensor will send a "yes"
39%. From that number we can further infer that the probability we're going to
read a "yes" is 39% * 60% = 23%.

sent1 influences recvd1: This follows from the problem description.

## (b)

We know P(rain2nd) = 65% and P(- rain2nd) = 35%, because we know it rained the
first day.

Question asks P(rain4th).

P(rain4th) = P(rain4th | rain3rd) . P(rain3rd)
                + P(rain4th | - rain3rd) .  P(-rain3rd)

P(rain3rd) = P(rain3rd | rain2nd) . P(rain2nd)
                + P(rain3rd | - rain2nd) .  P(rain2nd)

P(rain2nd)   = 65%
P(- rain2nd) = 35%

P(rain3rd) = 65% . 65% + 25% . 35%
           = 51%
P(- rain3rd) = 49%

P(rain4th) = 65% . 51% + 25% . 49%
P(rain4th) = 45%
