# Question 1

We're looking for these two formations:

    G B G B G B G B -- first case
    B G B G B G B G -- second case

In total they can land in

        8!
    --------- = 70 different formations.
     4! * 4!    (repeated permutation)

In 70 different formations, we're looking for 2 specific formations, shown above
as "first case" and "second case". So the probability is:

     2
    ---- = 0.0285
     70
