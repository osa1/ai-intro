# NOTE [Brute-force approach]
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# The way I attack problems is usually this: I first design or maybe even
# implement a brute-force solution, then if needed I optimize on that.
#
# Let's think about how we can come up with a brute-force solution for this
# problem.
#
# Let's say the points we currently get is P. We can consider re-throwing all
# subset of our dice. Given that we have 5 dice, that'd make 2^5 = 32 dice
# sets(actually this is not really a set since we have repetitions).
#
# Then for each subset, we consider what happens if we re-throw that subset.
# Let's say we consider a subset with 4 dice. We have 6^4 = 1296 different
# outcomes, each one has same probability, but we have repetitions. For every
# outcome, we check maximum points we could get.
#
# At this point here's all the information we have:
#
# - Best points we can get, without any re-throws.
# - For each subset of dice, points we can get with a re-throw. Each one has
#   same probability(but we have repetitions).
#
# Now, under what circumstances should we re-throw instead of accepting current
# dice set? I have no ideas, but let's say we re-throw if we have at least 30%
# of probability that we'll get a better point.
#
# Now we need to calculate some probabilities. Our results tables have
# repetitions. If we have two entries in table entry for re-throwing all 5 dice
# that give us same points, this means that probability of having this points is
# actually not 1 / all_possibilities, it's larger.
#
# So we need to remove repetitions and generate probabilities.
#
# Here's how we generate the table for this:
#
# - For each _distinct_ subset of current dice:
#   (by _distinct_ we mean that if we currently have [1, 1, 1, 1, 2],
#   [0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3] etc. are all the same)
#
#   - We check if the outcome is in the table. If it is, we increment it's
#     probability by one.
#
#   - If it's not in the table, we create the entry with probability one.
#
# - Then, for each entry in the table, we calculate maximum points we get, and
#   note the card that gives this. (of course we take care of previously used
#   cards etc.)
#
# - Then, we normalize probabilities. We apply the usual procedure etc.
#
# - If there's a chance that with more than 30% probability we increase our
#   income, then we do the re-throw.
#
# (We should probably play around with 30% to find a better number here)
#
# Of course, this is a very naive implementation. We don't consider the fact
# that we can re-throw one more time if first time we don't get good result. We
# also don't consider the fact that with current set of dice, we may consider
# having less points, just to save some cards to better sets.
#
# Still, I think it's a good spot between super powerful but hard to code vs.
# easy to code but dumb.
