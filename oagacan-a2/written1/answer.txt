I do a search while keeping these in mind:

- There has been 4 moves, and two black pieces are missing. This means that two
  of the 4 white moves were capturing moves.

- Since last move was done by black, that last move has to be D6.

- Last move has to be a capturing move, and it has to capture white's knight.
  The reason is this:

  - White moved only it's knight at B1.
    (he could also move it's other knight, but there is simply not enough moves
    for moving both knights and capturing two black pieces etc.)

  - So in his 4th move, white has to move his knight.

  - If black didn't capture white's knight which was moved in white's 4th
    turn, then we would see white's knight on the board. It's not there, which
    means black has captured it in his last move.

- Whichever piece captured white's knight has to be on board in this last state.

- White's knight captured black's knight.

- White's knight captured one of black's pawns.

- So 2 out of 4 white moves involved capturing some pieces.

- There's no way to capture anything in first move. So white has 3 moves in
  which 2 of them involved capturing black's pieces.

- Only way for white to capture something in his second move is this:

  B1 C3 - D7 D5 - C3 D5

  - But this state is impossible to solve. The reason is because now white
    knight has to somehow move do D6 and this takes at least 3 moves, but he
    only has 2 more moves. Also, there's no way to capture black's knights
    while doing these moves.

- So we consider last possibility: White has to capture two pieces in it's last
  two moves.

...

At this point we just consider all the possibilities. I've even written a
program for this(see search.py). This is unsolvable.
